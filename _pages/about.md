Lab Directorâ€™s Bio
======
[Dr. Yukun Lu](https://www.unb.ca/faculty-staff/directory/engineering-mechanical/lu-yukun.html) joined the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/engineering/depts/mechanical/index.html) at the [University of New Brunswick](https://www.unb.ca/) as an Assistant Professor in July 2025. She also serves as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). She earned her Ph.D. in [Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/) from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in 2023, where she continued as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Mechatronic Vehicle Systems Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechatronic-vehicle-systems-lab/). She holds a B.Eng. in Vehicle Engineering with a minor in Business Administration, completed in 2018. Her background and future research interests include ground vehicle corner modules, intelligent robotic mobility, data-driven learning-based control strategies, vehicle dynamics and control, etc.

Research Topics
======
**Autonomous Log Loading and Transportation in Forestry**

Log loading in forestry involves the use of specialized equipment, such as log loaders and cranes, to lift, move, and stack logs onto trucks or trailers for transport. To improve efficiency and safety in forestry operations, we aim to develop a modular autonomous platooning system equipped with assist log-loading technology.

**Robotic Mobility with Tracked and Wheeled Corner Modules for Forestry and Agriculture**

This robotic platform features a modular chassis capable of transitioning between tracked and wheeled mobility. The tracked system ensures superior traction on soft, uneven, or loose surfaces, making it ideal for navigating through mud, snow, or forest floors. The wheeled corner module system enhances maneuverability and speed on firmer ground, optimizing performance for mixed-terrain environments. We aim to develop a fleet of autonomous robotic mobility for sustainable land management in forestry and agriculture.

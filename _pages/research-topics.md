**Truck-Navigator**

Truck Navigator is an experience-driven, self-evolving safety and passability mapping system that functions as a digital co-driver for heavy-duty trucks operating on regular routes (such as in forestry or mining operations). It continuously improves with each run by aggregating data on road geometry (curvature, grade, width), vehicle dynamics and limits (e.g., safe cornering speeds and braking distances under various loads), weather and surface conditions, and known hazard hotspots, thereby constructing a high-fidelity route knowledge base that captures the physical and operational constraints of these vehicles. Inspired by rally racing pace notes, the system translates this knowledge into human-readable driving instructions for each segment of the route, such as recommending safe speeds for upcoming curves under specific conditions, suggesting optimal deceleration points before steep descents, and issuing alerts for high-risk areas. A key innovation is the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) for enhanced perception and guidance: using truck-mounted cameras, the system’s VLM interprets visual cues in real time, and it automatically generates natural-language driving guidance on the fly.

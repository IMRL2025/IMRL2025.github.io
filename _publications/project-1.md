title: "Robotic Mobility with Tracked and Wheeled Corner Modules for Forestry and Agriculture"
permalink: /publication/project-1
---
This robotic platform features a modular chassis capable of transitioning between tracked and wheeled mobility. The tracked system ensures superior traction on soft, uneven, or loose surfaces, making it ideal for navigating through mud, snow, or forest floors. The wheeled corner module system enhances maneuverability and speed on firmer ground, optimizing performance for mixed-terrain environments. We aim to develop a fleet of autonomous robotic mobility for sustainable land management in forestry and agriculture.
